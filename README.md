# ORCA-and-Qutip-Calculations
Stores the files for my paper: Identification of Dominant Vibronic Relaxation Channels in the Eu(dpphen)(NO3)3 Nuclear Spin Qubit

This will include:
* Orca input files (geometry optimization / frequency file and property files)
* Orca output files
* Optimized geometry file (.xyz)
* Redfield theory custom script

Notes:
* eu_freq.out contains the frequency / geometry optimization output
* prop2.out contains all property calculations for the first 20 excited states
* prop3.out contains the HR factors and property calculations for states 20 to 30
* redfield.ipynb contains the custom QuTiP script I used to get the T1 time
